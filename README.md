# Ship Breaking Workspace
This repository containts the packages/code for the workspace.

The workspace is located under mqp_ws, it already contains a src folder

## Setup
Simply following the ROS tutorials is enough, just cd into mqp_ws and run 'catkin_make'.  That should setup all packages and files (make sure to run 'source devel/setup.bash' when done).

Make sure moveit and all other necessary packages are installed as well, otherwise there will be errors and some things might not work.

## Organization
This workspace is a subfolder of this repository in case additional supporting files need to be added around it.  If necessary, this can be easily reorganized and cleaned up to work with your project.
